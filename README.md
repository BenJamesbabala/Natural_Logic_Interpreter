![alt text](hi.png "Logo Title Text 1")

## Description
NLI automatically interprets and validates nested natural logic arguments based
on rules of inference and propositional logic. The program uses "divide and conquer" algorithms
using recursive methods to go through nested logical arguments and to be able to define
and validate them accordingly.
